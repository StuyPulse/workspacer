To setup:
- put gui.jar (see Team694/java-education.git) in ./gui.jar

- run `make setup`.

After this, users can run `/tmp/launch.o` to login or create a user.


Notes for developers:
- `/tmp/launch.o` has the SUID (set user-id) bit set by `make setup`.
  Executables respect the SUID bit, but scripts do not.  This means `launch.o`
  and `interface.o` run with euid (effective user-id) of the file owner, but
  when they call shell scripts, those shell scripts run with the euid of the
  *original* caller. Those scripts can interact with `their-work/` only because
  `their-work/` has the same permissions as `/tmp` (rwx-able by all, with the
  sticky bit set).
