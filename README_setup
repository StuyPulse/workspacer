- put gui.jar (see Team694/java-education.git) in ./gui.jar

- compile and run ./totmp to get the binary into tmp. For some
  reason, when the binary is run at /home/wilson/workspacing/a.out
  the euid isn't set, but it is when run from /tmp/java-eduaction.out

- the files must be in a directory publicly readable and executable

- Run `mkdir their-work`
