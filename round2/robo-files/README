# robo-files

Here be files which should be copied to /var/tmp/robo-files of the users'
machines, and linked to in their workspaces.

E.g., the Makefile in workspace-template/Makefile is a symbolic link to
`/var/tmp/robo-files/Makefile`. This way we can easily change the Makefile
for everyone by changing `robo-files/Makefile`.
